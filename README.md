# face_mask_detection

### INTRODUCTION
In this project we will make is face mask detector using computer vision and 
machine Learning. We introduce a mask face detection model that is based on 
computer vision and deep learning. The proposed model can be integrated with 
surveillance cameras to impede the COVID-19 transmission by allowing the 
detection of people who are wearing masks not wearing face masks


### OBJECTIVES
In this PROJECT we created a COVID-19 face mask detector using OpenCV and 
machine Learning.
To create our face mask detector, we trained a two-class model of people wearing masks 
and people not wearing masks. 
We then took this face mask classifier and applied it to images by: Detecting faces in 
images.
Extracting each individual face
Applying our face mask classifier ; then Our face mask detector is accurate
